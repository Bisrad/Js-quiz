Practice Project in HTML, CSS, and Js. To Build and Develope a quiz web app with mulitple questions that utilizes localstorage to save users highscores in a ranked fashion.

### What I Learned in this Project 

I choose to work on this project to expand my knowledge of JS, and how to add key functions for user experience. I was tasked with developing and designing multiple pages with interactive buttons and a quiz. This involved creating a Question Array, saving information in Local Storage, creating a Countdown Timer/Loader Animation, and understanding Mapping, JSON Fetching amongst may other JS concepts. The Game was styled with Bootswatch.
